Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using  Eclipse, Java, Maven, Selenium 3.

Test Subject

I've picked www.daraz.com.bd and www.rokomari.com as a test subject for no particular reason. This are a large e-commerce site and does have variety of features that we can play around with.

Libraries and Frameworks

Selenium - Web automation

Maven - Build and package management

Programming Language

I'm using Java SE version jdk1.8.0_111 and it works very well. There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:

It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.

It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.

Because of the above two points it's possible to automate (testing) checking for iOS (Web and Native), Android (Web and Native) and Web platforms.
